Life is like a hurricane
Here in Duckburg
Race cars, lasers, aeroplanes
It's a duck-blur!
Might solve a mystery
Or rewrite history!
DuckTales! Woo-oo!
Every day they're out there making
DuckTales! Woo-oo!
Tales of derring-do
Bad and good luck tales!
D-d-d-danger! Lurks behind you!
There's a stranger out to find you
What to do, just grab on to some...
DuckTales! Woo-oo!
Every day they're out there making
DuckTales! Woo-oo!
Tales of derring-do
Bad and good luck tales! Woo-oo!
Not pony tales or cotton tales, no
DuckTales! Woo-oo!
